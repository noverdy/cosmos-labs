# Speaker Notes & Talking Points

## Slide 2: My Journey: 4 Years in the Making

### Talking Points:
- **Personal Connection**: "Four years ago, I was sitting exactly where you are now - in this exact room, at this exact event."
- **Relatability**: Share a funny story about being a freshman organizer - maybe you were stressed about getting people to show up, or you messed up scheduling.
- **Vulnerability**: "Back then, I thought 'secure coding' was just adding a password field. I had no idea..."
- **Growth Journey**: "From that freshman who barely understood HTML to now finding vulnerabilities in production systems."
- **Coffee Humor**: "The one thing that hasn't changed? I still need 3 cups of coffee before touching any production code!"

### Engagement Questions:
- "How many of you have ever built something and thought 'eh, security is someone else's problem'?"
- "Raise your hand if you've ever hardcoded a password 'just for testing'?"

## Slide 3: Why I'm Passionate About This

### Talking Points:
- **The Shocking Discovery**: "I found SQL injection in my own university project - a course registration system that could have exposed every student's personal data."
- **The Reality Check**: "That moment when I realized I could have compromised my classmates' information was terrifying."
- **The "Why"**: "Security isn't about being perfect - it's about not being the reason someone's data gets stolen."
- **Student Advantage**: "You're learning this stuff in your first year. I didn't touch real security until my third year. You're already ahead."

### Key Message:
- Small mistakes have real consequences
- Learning security early is a huge advantage
- It's not about being perfect, it's about being better

## Slide 4: The Same Mistakes I Made as a Freshman, Are the Same Mistakes That Cost Companies Millions Today

### Talking Points:
- **Personal Connection**: "The exact same rookie mistakes I made 4 years ago - hardcoding passwords, not validating input - these are the same vulnerabilities I find in production systems today."
- **The Bridge**: "There's no magical transformation from 'student mistakes' to 'professional mistakes'. They're literally the same coding errors, just with bigger consequences."
- **The Hook**: "What if I told you that 4 simple coding mistakes - the ones I made, the ones you might be making right now - are the same ones costing companies millions in data breaches?"
- **The Journey**: "I went from making these mistakes in university projects to finding these exact same mistakes in real companies that pay me to fix them."
- **The Value**: "The fact that you're learning this now means you're already ahead of where I was 4 years ago."

## Slide 5: XSS: The Page Hijacker

### Talking Points:
- **Business Impact**: "Imagine visiting your university website and suddenly seeing a gambling interface instead. That's exactly what happens with XSS - legitimate pages get hijacked."
- **My Personal Story**: "I found this in a university student portal. I could take over ANY student's account just by putting some code in my profile. Think about what that means - access to grades, personal info, everything."
- **The Hook**: "This isn't about some technical concept - it's about someone turning your trusted university website into a fake gambling site to scam people."
- **Relatability**: "You've all seen gambling ads popup. Imagine if your actual university webpage became one of those sites."

### Visual Focus:
- Show before/after: normal university page → gambling page
- Simple diagram: Evil script → Page hijack → Users see gambling
- Keep it business-focused, not technical

### Key Message:
- "This affects real users, real money, real trust"
